A number of tools are available to interrogate to which compound(s) a particular MS/MS spectrum might correspond:  
  
  - [mzCloud](https://beta.mzcloud.org/dataviewer#/app/dataviewer/search/spectrum)  
  - [MASST](https://masst.ucsd.edu/)  
  - [SIRIUS](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/)
  - [MoNA - MassBank of North America](https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/spectra/search)  
  - [MassBank Europe](https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Search)  
    
<br>
In the examples listed below I will first show how to extract the MS/MS spectra of interest and then how to search for the compound(s) it might correspond to by using the aforementioned tools:  
    
  - [Example 1](https://mar-garcia.github.io/training_metabolomics/practical/annotation/example1.html)  
  - [Example 2](https://mar-garcia.github.io/training_metabolomics/practical/annotation/example2.html)
