A number of tools are available to interrogate to which compound(s) a particular MS/MS spectrum might correspond:  
  
  - [mzCloud](https://beta.mzcloud.org/dataviewer#/app/dataviewer/search/spectrum)  
  - [MASST](https://masst.ucsd.edu/)  
  - Sirius
  - MoNA  
  - MassBank  
    
<br>
In the examples listed below I will first show how to extract the MS/MS spectra of interest and then how to search for the compound(s) it might correspond to by using the aforementioned tools:  
    
  - [Example 1](https://mar-garcia.github.io/training_metabolomics/practical/annotation/example1.html)  
  - [Example 2](https://mar-garcia.github.io/training_metabolomics/practical/annotation/example2.html)
