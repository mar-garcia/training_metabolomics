It encompasses a series of activities that provide a mechanism to ensure that measurements are repeatable.  
<br/>
**Key concepts in Quality Management (QM):**  
  
-   Quality Assurance (QA) is related to the procedures applied before and during data acquisition  
-   Quality control (QC) refers to the procedures applied in the individual measures to assess if the quality requirements have been achieved

## Quality Assurance
  
  - Standardized training  
  - Use of standard operating procedures (SOPs)
  - Instrument calibration  
  - Instrument system suitability tests (SSTs)  
  - Ensure the quality requirements are fulfilled before starting a sequence

## Quality Control  
  
Analysis of signals detected in QC samples


## QC materials

Types of samples/mixtures prepared to assess the quality of the data:
  
  -   Pooled samples (study-specific, intra-batch, long-term QC)  
  -   Phenotypic pooled samples
  -   Commercially available sample
  -   Synthetic chemical standards mixture  
  -   Blanks

## Design of QC program
  
  - Type of QC samples  
  - Frequency of QC sample injection  
  - Randomization of study samples  
  - Parameters to monitor data from QC samples

## System Suitability Tests (SSTs)  
  
- Examination of background noise  
- Chromatographic peak shape  
- Mass accuracy & stability  
- Retention time stability  
- Intensity stability  


## Evaluation of QC samples along injection queue  
  
  - General random/systematic effects monitorization (PCA)  
  - Within-feature analysis precision (mass accuracy/stability, RT/intensity stability)   
  - Within-feature linearity
