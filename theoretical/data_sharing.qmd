# Reproducibility

"Reproducibility is a cornerstone of the scientific process: only if my colleagues can reproduce my work should they trust its veracity"

## Replication crisis

"More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments"

# Standardization

---

Standards make the information more accessible and enable the extraction of maximum value from data sets.  

  - Standardization of terminology for an unambiguous description (ontologies)   
  - Appropriate reporting of the methodology: details of the experiment are critical for data interpretation and re-use

## The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI)

  
  - Need for data reporting standards such as checklist, minimal information required and common semantics  
  - Formed in 2005 by leading experts in metabolomics with support from the Metabolomics Society

  - In 2007 MSI published a series of reporting standards for metabolomics: Metabolomics: 2007;3(3):175-256

## The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI)

Aimed to provide a common mechanism for describing the work, not to prescribe how an experiment has to be carried out

Working groups:  
  
  - Biological context metadata  
  - Chemical analysis  
  - Data processing

# Data Sharing

Sharing for repeatability is essential to ensure that colleagues and reviewers can evaluate our results based on accurate and complete evidence -> data sharing is needed for reproduce and reuse (data publication is insufficient)

## Code repository services  
    
  - Complex pipelines (processing and analysis)  
  - Good programming practices for reproducibility  
  
**Git repositories:**  
Commonly used platforms fo computational resoure sharing: [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)  
<br>
**Containers:**    
Containers (i.e., docker) to package software/code computational environment


## FAIR Data Principles
  
FAIR is the acronym for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.   
Concepts defined to enhance the reusability of scientific data.  

::: incremental   
  
  * **Findable:** Metadata and data should be easy to find -> Data need to be uploadable to data
repositories    
  * **Accessible:** Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed -> The repository should be visible for the scientific community and publicly available

## FAIR Data Principles

::: incremental   
  
  * **Interoperable:** The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing -> Uploaded data require a harmonized format and common units to enable shared data from different sources  
  * **Reusable:** metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings -> Data must be comparable, with long-term validity and independent of time
